'''
Drives the Raspberry Pi

Sets up & coordinates the multiple threads needed to function as a standalone taskontrol client
    -State Control: Managing box I/O and the state matrix
    -Audio Server
    -Communication w/ home terminal via TCP/IP

To Do (Initial, 6/22/16):
    -Build initialization method that does first setup to store location of host terminal, data, etc.
    -Build calibration method
    -Build in threading/multiprocessing
    -Sounds should be a) parameterized in the protocol file, and b) handled/defined in the sounds file
        -So the mouse object is saved with the parameters for the protocol, then RPilot loads the task template w/ those
        parameters so it is the child of RPilot, then the functions in the task template have access to RPilot methods.

        Refresher on the terminology that's been adopted: a "Protocol" is a collection of "Steps", each of which is a "Task" with promotion criteria to the next step.
            Each task is composed of "stages" which are the individual points of decision and response that the RPi and mouse engage in.
        Tasks are run "stagewise," where the run function calls next() on the iterator that contains the stage functions.
            Tasks are only recognized as such when an "end_trial" trigger is returned by the stage function, prompting the
            RPilot to save the trial's data. Otherwise they are run continuously.
        Each run cycle proceeds:
            -check_ready(): checks if everything has been prepared for the trial. The Task should provide a list of things to check (not implemented yet)
            -subject.task.next(): computes the logic for the next trial stage, returns data, triggers, and timers.
            -handle_triggers(): if triggers aren't returned as callable functions (rewards, for example, can't be
                returned as functions b/c the task doesn't know about the reward hardware), we make them callable.
